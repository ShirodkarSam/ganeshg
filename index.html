             (Gaṇeśōtsava), is a Hindu festival commemorating the birth of the Hindu god Ganesha. The festival is marked
             with the installation of Ganesha's clay idols privately in homes and publicly on elaborate pandals 
             (temporary stages). Observances include chanting of Vedic hymns and Hindu texts, such as prayers and vrata
              (fasting). Offerings and prasada from the daily prayers, that are distributed from the pandal to the 
              community, include sweets such as modaka as it is believed to be a favourite of Ganesha. The festival ends
               on the tenth day after start, when the idol is carried in a public procession with music and group 
               chanting, then immersed in a nearby body of water such as a river or sea, called visarjan on the day of 
               Anant Chaturdashi. In Mumbai alone, around 150,000 statues are immersed annually.Thereafter the clay idol
                dissolves and Ganesha is believed to return to his celestial abode.

            In Maharashtra, Ganesh Chaturthi is known as Ganeshotsav. Families install small clay statues for 
            worship during the festival. At home, the festival preparation includes purchases such as puja 
            items or accessories a few days in advance and booking the Ganesh murti as early as a month 
            beforehand (from local artisans). The murti is brought home either a day before or on the day of 
            the Ganesh Chaturthi itself. Families decorate a small, clean portion of the house with flowers 
            and other colourful items before installing the idol. When the Murti is installed, it and its 
            shrine are decorated with flowers and other materials. On the day of the festival, The ceremonial 
            installation of the clay murti (idol) is done along with chants of holy mantras and pooja including 
            bhajans during a certain auspicious period of the day. The Murti is worshipped in the morning and 
            evening with offerings of flowers, durva (strands of young grass), karanji and modaks 
            (jaggery and coconut flakes wrapped in rice flour dumplings). The worship ends with the singing of an
             aarti in honour of Ganesh, other Gods and Saints.

            Samarth Ramdas is sung. Family traditions differ about when to end the celebration. Domestic
             celebrations end after 1+12, 3, 5, 7 or 11 days. At that time the Murti is ceremoniously brought 
             to a body of water (such as a lake, river or the sea) for immersion. In Maharashtra, Ganeshotsav 
             also incorporates other festivals, namely Hartalika and the Gauri festival, the former is observed
              with a fast by women on the day before Ganesh Chaturthi whilst the latter by the installation of 
              statues of Gauris. In some communities such as the Chitpavan, and the CKP, pebbles collected from
               river bank are installed as representations of Gauri.
